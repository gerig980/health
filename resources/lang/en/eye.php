The surgery lasts about 1 hour and is almost painless. The eye surgeon will explain the procedure and also how to protect your eye after cataract surgery. You will be given eye drops to help your eye heal. Your eye may feel a bit itchy or uncomfortable and sensitive to light and touch. After 1 or 2 days, your eye should feel better.
